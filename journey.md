## Theme System Evolution

### Latest Developments
- Successfully implemented color initialization and retrieval system
- Added comprehensive error logging for theme-related operations
- Improved error handling in terminal operations
- Identified and documented display refresh behavior after login

### Current Challenges
1. **Interface Refresh Issue**
   - System shows a display refresh after login
   - Colors are properly initialized but interface redraws
   - Investigation ongoing into potential causes

2. **Theme Initialization**
   - Color values are being set correctly
   - Need to ensure single initialization
   - Considering state management improvements

### Lessons Learned
- Importance of detailed logging for debugging
- Need for careful state management in UI systems
- Value of incremental improvements in complex systems

## Theme System and Title Bar Improvements

### Debug and Fix Session (2024)
- Investigated blank screen issue after login
- Added debug prints throughout startup sequence to trace execution flow
- Discovered title bar was blocking debug messages
- Temporarily disabled title bar to verify theme initialization
- Fixed nil title error in theme.drawTitleBar function
- Added default title fallback for robustness
- Successfully resolved blank screen issue

Fixed the title bar showing up as nil - turns out it needed a default value. Still need to figure out why the terminal's not responding though.

Key Improvements:
1. Enhanced error handling in Theme.lua
2. Added fallback title text to prevent nil errors
3. Improved debug message visibility
4. Fixed theme initialization sequence

## Development Notes
- Keep UI minimalistic and retro-styled
- Maintain modular architecture
- Focus on crash resilience
- Ensure CC:Tweaked compatibility
