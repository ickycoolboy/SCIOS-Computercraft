# SCIOS Development Journey

## Current Status (Checkpoint)

### System Initialization Challenges
- **Critical Issue**: Persistent system initialization failures
- **Last Debugging Focus**: Color initialization and error handling
- **Key Modifications**:
  1. Enhanced color retrieval in `Theme.lua`
  2. Added robust fallback mechanisms
  3. Improved error logging

### Pending Tasks
- [ ] Complete system initialization debugging
- [ ] Verify module loading sequence
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error recovery

### Recent Changes
- Modified `getColor()` function to be more resilient
- Added comprehensive fallback color mechanisms
- Improved error handling in login process

### Next Steps
1. Investigate remaining system initialization bottlenecks
2. Add more detailed logging for module loading
3. Implement a more robust startup sequence

### Development Notes
- Focus on simplicity and error tolerance
- Prioritize system stability
- Maintain clean, readable code

## Theme System Evolution

### Latest Developments
- Successfully implemented color initialization and retrieval system
- Added comprehensive error logging for theme-related operations
- Improved error handling in terminal operations
- Identified and documented display refresh behavior after login

### Current Challenges
1. **Interface Refresh Issue**
   - System shows a display refresh after login
   - Colors are properly initialized but interface redraws
   - Investigation ongoing into potential causes

2. **Theme Initialization**
   - Color values are being set correctly
   - Need to ensure single initialization
   - Considering state management improvements

### Lessons Learned
- Importance of detailed logging for debugging
- Need for careful state management in UI systems
- Value of incremental improvements in complex systems

## Theme System and Title Bar Improvements

### Debug and Fix Session (2024)
- Investigated blank screen issue after login
- Added debug prints throughout startup sequence to trace execution flow
- Discovered title bar was blocking debug messages
- Temporarily disabled title bar to verify theme initialization
- Fixed nil title error in theme.drawTitleBar function
- Added default title fallback for robustness
- Successfully resolved blank screen issue

Fixed the title bar showing up as nil - turns out it needed a default value. Still need to figure out why the terminal's not responding though.

Key Improvements:
1. Enhanced error handling in Theme.lua
2. Added fallback title text to prevent nil errors
3. Improved debug message visibility
4. Fixed theme initialization sequence

## Development Notes
- Keep UI minimalistic and retro-styled
- Maintain modular architecture
- Focus on crash resilience
- Ensure CC:Tweaked compatibility
