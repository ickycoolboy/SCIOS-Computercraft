# SCIOS

Just a fun little OS I'm making for CC:Tweaked. Had to put it on GitHub to make the auto-update feature work (and it's a nice backup too). It's got that cool retro look but with modern features - pretty neat!

## Features

- 🎨 Customizable themes (because who doesn't like options?)
- 🧩 Modular design (makes adding stuff easier)
- 🌐 Network features (computers talking to computers)
- 🎮 Games support 
- 🪟 Window management (like a proper OS)
- 🔒 User accounts (WIP)

## Installation

If you want to try it out, just paste this into your CC computer:
```lua
wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ickycoolboy/SCIOS-Computercraft/Github-updating-test/Installer.lua
```

## How It Works

Main parts:
- `Commands.lua` - Handles the commands
- `DisplayManager.lua` - Makes the screen work
- `Gui.lua` - Windows and stuff
- `Theme.lua` - Makes it look nice
- `Network.lua` - Computer communication
- `Login.lua` - Keeps things secure
- `Help.lua` - Explains how things work

## Development

This is mostly a personal project for fun, but I keep track of changes in:
- `journey.md` - Current tasks
- `project-log.md` - What's been done

## Notes

Feel free to use this however you want - it's open source.
