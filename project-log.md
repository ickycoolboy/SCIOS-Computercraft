# Project Development Log

## [Feature] Initial Project Setup
### Files: Installer.lua
- **Change**: I created the initial installer script with basic functionality
- **Reason**: I needed a clean way to deploy the OS to ComputerCraft computers
- **Outcome**: Users can now install SCIOS with a simple wget command

## [Documentation] Created Development Tracking
### Files: journey.md, project-log.md
- **Change**: I set up the development tracking structure
- **Reason**: I wanted a clear way to track progress and changes
- **Outcome**: Established an organized workflow for future development

## [Feature] Added Title Bar System
### Files: Theme.lua, Login.lua
- **Change**: I implemented a persistent purple title bar with white text
- **Reason**: I wanted consistent branding across all screens
- **Outcome**: Every screen (except login) now shows the SCIOS branding

## [Refactor] Improved Layout Management
### Files: Gui.lua, Theme.lua
- **Change**: I restructured the screen layout system
- **Reason**: The title bar needed dedicated space management
- **Outcome**: UI components now properly adjust to the reserved title bar space

## [Fix] Resolved Module Dependencies
### Files: Theme.lua, Gui.lua
- **Change**: I fixed the circular dependency between Theme and GUI
- **Reason**: I hit a 'gui is nil' error from improper dependencies
- **Outcome**: Screen dimension logic now lives in Theme.lua for better organization

## [Feature] Enhanced Window Management
### Files: Theme.lua, Gui.lua
- **Change**: I separated content and title bar window handling
- **Reason**: The title bar was getting lost during content scrolling
- **Outcome**: Title bar stays fixed while content scrolls independently

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing automated changelog generation
- Keep monitoring performance impacts of theme changes
- Track user feedback for installer improvements
