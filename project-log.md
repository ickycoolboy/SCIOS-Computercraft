# Project Development Log

## [2024-01-17]
### File: Installer.lua
- **Change**: Made minor updates to the installer script
- **Reason**: I wanted to improve code clarity and maintainability
- **Outcome**: The installer now has cleaner code structure

### File: Documentation
- **Change**: Created initial documentation structure with journey.md and project-log.md
- **Reason**: I needed a better way to track my development progress and changes
- **Outcome**: Established a clear documentation workflow for future development

### Files: Theme.lua, Login.lua
- **Change**: Added persistent SCI Sentinel OS title bar across all screens (except login)
- **Reason**: I wanted to maintain consistent branding and improve user interface cohesion
- **Outcome**: The OS now displays a purple title bar with white text at the top of every screen after login

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing automated changelog generation
- Keep monitoring performance impacts of theme changes
- Track user feedback for installer improvements
