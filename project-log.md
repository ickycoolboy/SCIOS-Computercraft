# Project Development Log

## [Feature] Initial Project Setup
### Files: Installer.lua
- **Change**: I created the initial installer script with basic functionality
- **Reason**: I needed a clean way to deploy the OS to ComputerCraft computers
- **Outcome**: Users can now install SCIOS with a simple wget command

## [Documentation] Created Development Tracking
### Files: journey.md, project-log.md
- **Change**: I set up the development tracking structure
- **Reason**: I wanted a clear way to track progress and changes
- **Outcome**: Established an organized workflow for future development

## [Feature] Added Title Bar System
### Files: Theme.lua, Login.lua
- **Change**: I implemented a persistent purple title bar with white text
- **Reason**: I wanted consistent branding across all screens
- **Outcome**: Every screen (except login) now shows the SCIOS branding

## [Refactor] Improved Layout Management
### Files: Gui.lua, Theme.lua
- **Change**: I restructured the screen layout system
- **Reason**: The title bar needed dedicated space management
- **Outcome**: UI components now properly adjust to the reserved title bar space

## [Fix] Resolved Module Dependencies
### Files: Theme.lua, Gui.lua
- **Change**: I fixed the circular dependency between Theme and GUI
- **Reason**: I hit a 'gui is nil' error from improper dependencies
- **Outcome**: Screen dimension logic now lives in Theme.lua for better organization

## [Feature] Enhanced Window Management
### Files: Theme.lua, Gui.lua
- **Change**: I separated content and title bar window handling
- **Reason**: The title bar was getting lost during content scrolling
- **Outcome**: Title bar stays fixed while content scrolls independently

## [Feature] Added Error Handling System
### Files: ErrorHandler.lua
- **Change**: I created a new error handling system with logging and recovery features
- **Reason**: To make SCIOS more stable and resilient to crashes
- **Outcome**: Added centralized error handling with logging and protected execution

## [Refactor] Integrated Error Handling System
### Files: Startup.lua, Sci_sentinel.lua
- **Change**: I integrated the error handler into core system modules
- **Reason**: To provide comprehensive crash protection across the OS
- **Outcome**: Added protected calls, fallback mechanisms, and error recovery for critical operations

## [Refactor] Enhanced Theme System with Error Handling
### Files: Theme.lua
- **Change**: I completely revamped the theme system with comprehensive error handling

  - Enhanced error logging during module loading
- **Outcome**: More resilient system initialization

## [Refactor] Error Handling System
### Files: Sci_sentinel.lua, ErrorHandler.lua
- **Change**: Improved error tracking and recovery mechanisms
- **Reason**: Enhance system stability and debugging capabilities
- **Details**:
  - Added more comprehensive error logging
  - Implemented protected call wrappers
  - Created fallback procedures for critical failures
- **Outcome**: Better system observability and error management

## Error Handling System Implementation - Part 2 (Continued)

### Known Issues to Address

1. **Critical: Line 14 Error in Protected Calls**
   - Error: `expected, got boolean` at line 14 in redirectTarget function
   - Location: Appears to be related to terminal redirection handling
   - Impact: Affects system startup and terminal management
   - Next Steps: Need to investigate the redirectTarget function implementation and its interaction with protected calls

### Next Steps

1. **Error Handling System**
   - Review and fix the redirectTarget function issue
   - Ensure consistent return value handling across all protected calls
   - Add more robust fallback mechanisms for critical operations

2. **Testing Requirements**
   - Test terminal redirection under various failure conditions
   - Verify error recovery mechanisms
   - Ensure proper logging of all error conditions

### Technical Notes

The line 14 error appears to be related to how protected calls handle return values in terminal redirection operations. This will need to be addressed in a separate session, focusing on:
- The implementation of redirectTarget
- How protected calls handle terminal objects
- The interaction between ErrorHandler and terminal redirection functions

## Current Development Focus
**Date: 2024**
**Priority: High**

#### Active Issue: Terminal Freeze After Login
- **Status**: Under Investigation
- **Symptoms**: Terminal becomes unresponsive after successful login
- **Progress**:
  - Confirmed theme initialization is working
  - Added debug prints to trace execution flow
  - Fixed nil title error in theme system
- **Next Steps**:
  - Debug post-login execution sequence
  - Verify shell environment initialization
  - Check for potential blocking operations
  - Review command processing system

#### Technical Investigation Points:
1. Shell environment setup in Sci_sentinel.lua
2. Command processing in Login.lua
3. Terminal state management in Theme.lua
4. Error handling during shell initialization

This is currently the main focus of development efforts.

## Current Issue (2024)
Terminal freezes after login. Fixed the nil title error but the system's still locking up post-login.

What works:
- Theme loads fine
- Login process completes
- Title bar displays correctly

What's broken:
- Terminal freezes right after login
- Can't type commands
- Shell might be stuck somewhere

Looking at:
- Shell setup in Sci_sentinel
- Login.lua command handling
- Theme terminal state

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing automated changelog generation
- Keep monitoring performance impacts of theme changes
- Track user feedback for installer improvements
